# Craft2d

A very basic 2D Minecraft clone done in JavaFX

## Compiling and running

1. Download JavaFX sdk (version >= 14).
2. Copy all the files in sdk's `lib` into `./lib`.
3. Copy sdk's `bin` into project's folder.
4. Execute `./start.sh`

> On Windows, you can use WSL or git bash to run that shell script.

## Controls

Open the game and see `Key Bindings`
It is basically the same as playing Minecraft.
